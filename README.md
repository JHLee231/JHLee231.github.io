# LoRA-RL for Analog Circuit Sizing

This repository accompanies the paper **“LoRA-RL: Low-Rank Adaptation Enables Fast, Transferable Reinforcement Learning for Analog Circuit Optimization.”**

- *Goal*: reuse a pre-trained GCN-RL backbone and fine-tune only low-rank (LoRA) adapters when moving to a new CMOS process node.  
- *Result*: up to **8× faster convergence** and higher FoM on four amplifier benchmarks (A–D) in TSMC 45 nm.
